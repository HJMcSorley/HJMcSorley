:wave: Hi, Iâ€™m @HJMcSorley (Hannah Jane McSorley)

I specialize in water science. :droplet:

:eyes: My research background started with environmental analytical chemistry, which focused on water quality. ðŸŒ² That lead to applied research in forest hydrology (and water quality), as well as high-elevation weather station installations, maintenance, data aquisition and analysis :mountain:. I've worked in quantifying water quality parameters in natural surface waters and industrially contaminated groundwater, measuring and estimating streamflow, snowpack and snow-water-equivalent values. Hydrologic systems are complex and their data are integral to resource operations and daily life. :droplet:

:smiley: I like working with data in R. Iâ€™m interested in reproducible (and statistically defensible) data analysis workflows, and R (and RStudio IDE) are lovely for these purposes.
